        Certainly, here's a one-minute speech summarizing the TED Talk "The Skill of Self-Confidence":

"In this enlightening TED Talk, the speaker unravels the art of self-confidence, portraying it as a skill that can be acquired. They emphasize the idea that self-confidence is not an inborn quality, but rather a capability that anyone can nurture and develop.

The core message revolves around setting achievable goals, breaking larger aspirations into manageable steps, and celebrating small successes along the way. By doing so, individuals gradually build their self-confidence through a series of accomplishments.

The talk also places strong emphasis on the power of positive self-talk and self-affirmation. The words we tell ourselves greatly influence our self-perception, which, in turn, impacts our level of confidence. The speaker encourages us to replace self-doubt with self-affirming thoughts and beliefs.

Furthermore, the speaker urges the audience to embrace discomfort and the occasional prospect of failure. They argue that true growth and self-confidence are often born from taking risks and learning from setbacks, rather than avoiding them.

In just one minute, you've gained insights into the essence of self-confidence as a skill that can be honed. It's about setting realistic goals, changing negative self-talk to positive self-affirmation, and having the courage to step outside your comfort zone. This TED Talk is a reminder that self-confidence is within reach for anyone willing to nurture it, empowering them to chase their dreams with newfoundÂ assurance."
